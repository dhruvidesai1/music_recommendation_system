A content-based music recommendation system using a Spotify dataset from Kaggle. It recommends songs based on their similarity in **artist**, **genre**, **album**, and **user rating**.

## üìÇ Dataset

- The dataset (`ex.csv`) includes the following columns:
  - `Song-Name`
  - `Singer/Artists`
  - `Genre`
  - `Album/Movie`
  - `User-Rating`

---

## üß† Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed nulls and duplicates
   - Normalized text: stripped spaces, commas

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Combined `Singer/Artists`, `Genre`, `Album/Movie`, and `User-Rating` into a new column: `tags`

3. **Vectorization**:
   - Used **CountVectorizer** to convert `tags` into a numerical format

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - Used **cosine similarity** to find and recommend the top-N most similar songs
